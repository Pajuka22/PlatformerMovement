# PlatformerMovement
It is what it sounds like.
Ok so ur gonna need to do some stuff for this to work properly. First, the animations should be on a child object. It should be named "Sprite"
You'll also need to create empties called "Ground" and "Ceiling" which are also children. Place them where the ground and ceiling checks should be.
The gameobject you slap these scripts on should be called "Player".
Please make sure there's no typos, and if you want to change these names you'll also need to change the strings it's searching for in MovementController.cs
Other than that, I think this is pretty self explanatory. Have fun, i guess.
